Comic Generator
Overview
The Comic Generator is an interactive application that allows users to create custom comic-style visuals based on text prompts.

Dynamic Speech Bubbles: Automatically generates speech bubbles with text integrated into the comic panels.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio, allowing easy input of prompts and real-time comic generation.
Local Deployment: Can be run locally on your machine, with options for sharing via a public link.
